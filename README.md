## About The Project
![job-scraper](https://github.com/Jay-Sung-Lim/Remote-Job-Scraper/assets/107202611/2db19355-ea49-497c-821e-5af8701b8f21)

The Remote Job Scraper project is built using Python and Flask. It leverages the BeautifulSoup4 library to extract and present data from job listings on websites like We Work Remotely (WWR) and Remoteok based on user-specified keywords. Users can also download the job listings as a CSV file for further analysis and reference. This project has been deployed using Replit, a cloud-based development environment.
